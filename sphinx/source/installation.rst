Installation
#############

This module consists of a single class contained in ``XPS_Experiment.py``, therefore there is no actual installation process.
You just need to download the file mentioned and keep it in your project directory. However, you do need to have the library
`Xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ installed, because that's the data structure used to store the data in
this class. To import it to your code and use its features, import it like so:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from XPS_Experiment import XPS_Experiment
